If strides is a single number, then `strideHeight ==\n * strideWidth`.\n * @param pad The type of padding algorithm.\n *   - `same` and stride 1: output will be of same size as input,\n *       regardless of filter size.\n *   - `valid`: output will be smaller than input if filter is larger\n *       than 1x1.\n *   - For more info, see this guide:\n *     [https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/nn#Convolution](\n *          https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/nn#Convolution)\n * @param dilations The dilation rates: `[dilationHeight, dilationWidth]`\n *     in which we sample input values across the height and width dimensions\n *     in atrous convolution. Defaults to `[1, 1]`. If `rate` is a single\n *     number, then `dilationHeight == dilationWidth`. If it is greater than\n *     1, then all values of `strides` must be 1.\n * @param dataFormat: An optional string from: \"NHWC\", \"NCHW\". Defaults to\n *     \"NHWC\". Specify the data format of the input and output data. With the\n *     default format \"NHWC\", the data is stored in the order of: [batch,\n *     height, width, channels].
